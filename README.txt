https://youtu.be/h3l4qz76JhQ

!!! Before using: !!!
npm install

!!! To use this: !!!
npm run build [Will compile the TypeScript source to JavaScript]
npm run clean [Will delete all compiled files]
npm run test  [Will run all tests for lib files, written in Jasmine]
npm start     [Will run the compiled files using NodeJS]

!!! FACKS: !!!
Q= Why?
A= Because i could and i had time

Q= How?
A= I implemented all vector -array- operations, dot product, random and transpose
   to behave as similar as possible to numpy, then i just directly translated the
   code for the neural network class definition and use from python to TypeScript

Q= How much time did you spend creating this?
A= In total like 18 hours distributed in three weeks

Q= What license?
A= Come on. This is just didactic material and i did not designed it. Unlicensed.

Q= Any future plan for this?
A= Yes. As you can see there are a lot of comments and code sections written in
   spanish, because when i created this i did not plan to upload it to GH. I will
   change that in future commits. Also i will finish to implement some features that
   now only cover the part that the neural network needed. Also i want to make all
   those functions for general purpose, because now they are specific to the NN.

Q= The classes inside lib directory will be a neural network framework in the future?
A= Absolutely no. There are already in the market very good AI frameworks, and if i
   want a new feature i will add it to Tensorflow.js for example rather than start
   my own framework just for that.

Q= Any related project?
A= I wanted to implement a different neural network and i ended with three, an AND, 
   an OR and a XOR logic gates but in neural network using the same lib classes, but
   right now i need some money because the quarantine absorbed all my savings. So i
   will be working in some projects to get that money back and all my hobbie projects
   like this one will be halted until i get a stable money income. Sorry for that.

Q= Will you make a course on AI?
A= I would like to. But again, as i need money it will be a paid course.

Q= Can you please teach me what you know about AI speciffically to me?
A= I could try, but if it does not go well you will be angry with me. That'd be sad.

Q= Would you like to join my project?
A= Not now, i will not have a free time in a while.

Q= Can i join one of your projects?
A= As all my public projects are here in GH, yes. Just fork any of my repos.
